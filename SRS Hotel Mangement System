Application - Hotel Management System

Problem Statement:
Running a hotel involves a lot of work managing bookings, assigning rooms, checking guests in and out, handling bills, and keeping track of availability. Doing all this manually often leads to mistakes, double bookings, or delays. Guests get frustrated when their stay is not smooth. A system is needed to make hotel operations faster, easier, and more organized.

Software Requirements Specification (SRS):
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose of this Document
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements and specifications for the development of a Hotel Management System (HMS). It provides a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, features, and deliverables to ensure alignment between stakeholders, developers, and end-users.
1.2 Scope of this Document
The Hotel Management System will automate and streamline hotel operations, covering reservation management, guest check-in/check-out, room assignment, billing, reporting, and inventory management. This document also defines the estimated development cost, time frame, and technical considerations required for successful implementation.
1.3 Overview
The HMS is a software solution designed to improve hotel efficiency, enhance customer experience, and optimize resource utilization.
