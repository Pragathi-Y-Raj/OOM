Application - Passport Automation System

Problem Statement:
Getting a passport often takes too long because of paperwork, queues, and delays in verification. People don’t always know the status of their applications and have to make multiple visits to the office. A system is needed where citizens can apply online, book appointments, and track their passport status easily.
