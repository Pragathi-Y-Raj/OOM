Application - Credit Card Processing System

Problem Statement:
Today, people use credit cards everywhere hopping online, paying bills, or swiping at a store. But many businesses face problems with slow payments, errors, and security risks. Customers also get frustrated when transactions fail or take too long. We need a system that can process credit card payments quickly, safely, and without errors.

Software Requirements Specification (SRS):
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose of this Document
The purpose of this document is to provide a clear, concise, and detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Credit Card Processing System (CCPS). This document defines the functionality, features, constraints, and general system requirements to ensure successful development and implementation of the system.
1.2 Scope of this Document
This document covers all the essential information related to the development of the Credit Card Processing System, including functional and non-functional requirements, user interfaces, design constraints, and other system attributes. The system will be designed to handle credit card transactions securely and efficiently, including authorization, authentication, settlement, fraud detection, and reporting.
1.3 Overview
The Credit Card Processing System is designed to provide a secure and reliable solution for handling financial transactions made via credit cards. It ensures proper communication between merchants, banks, and customers while maintaining compliance with financial regulations and security standards (e.g., PCI-DSS).

2. General Description
2.1 General Functions
The main function of the Credit Card Processing System is to process and secure credit card transactions. The system will:
•	Allow merchants to submit card payment requests.
•	Authenticate and authorize transactions with issuing banks.
•	Handle transaction settlement between customer and merchant accounts.
•	Provide fraud detection and risk management.
•	Generate transaction reports and financial statements.

2.2 User Characteristics
The Credit Card Processing System will have three distinct types of users:
•	Admin: Responsible for system configuration, fraud monitoring, and generating compliance reports.
•	Merchant: Submits transactions for authorization, monitors payments, and manages settlements.
•	Customer (Cardholder): Uses their credit card for online or POS-based payments.

3. Functional Requirements
3.1 User Registration and Authentication
•	Requirement: Merchants and admins must be able to register and log in securely.
•	Outcome: Only authorized users can access the system.
•	Details: Multi-factor authentication and role-based access must be implemented.
3.2 Transaction Authorization
•	Requirement: Validate credit card details and check available balance with the issuing bank.
•	Outcome: Transactions will only be approved if valid.
•	Details: Use secure protocols to communicate with the bank’s system.
3.3 Transaction Settlement
•	Requirement: Transfer funds from the customer’s bank to the merchant’s bank.
•	Outcome: Completed transactions are settled accurately.
•	Details: Settlement should follow banking regulations and batch processes.
3.4 Fraud Detection and Risk Management
•	Requirement: Monitor transactions for suspicious activities.
•	Outcome: Fraudulent transactions are flagged or blocked.
•	Details: AI-based anomaly detection and blacklisted card verification.
3.5 Reporting and Auditing
•	Requirement: Generate transaction history and compliance reports.
•	Outcome: Merchants and admins can review past transactions and monitor system usage.
•	Details: Reports should be exportable in formats like PDF, Excel, and CSV.

4. Interface Requirements
4.1 Software Interfaces
•	Database: Relational database for storing transaction records securely.
•	Admin Interface: Web-based admin panel for fraud monitoring and report generation.
•	Merchant Interface: Web/mobile dashboard for transaction tracking.
4.2 Communication Interfaces
•	Web Interface: Transactions and dashboards accessed via HTTPS protocols.
•	Data Exchange: REST APIs using JSON/XML for bank and merchant communication.

5. Performance Requirements
5.1 System Response Time
•	Requirement: Authorization responses within 2–3 seconds.
•	Requirement: Settlement batch processing completed within standard banking timelines (e.g., T+1).
5.2 Scalability
•	Requirement: System should handle 5000 concurrent transactions during peak loads.
5.3 Database Performance
•	Requirement: Quick query execution for transaction lookup, fraud checks, and reporting.

6. Design Constraints
6.1 Technology Constraints
•	Requirement: The system must be developed using secure, stable frameworks such as Java (Spring Boot) or Python (Django/Flask).
•	Limitation: Must comply with PCI-DSS standards for credit card data storage and transmission.
6.2 Hardware Constraints
•	Requirement: Operate on secure servers with encryption modules (HSMs), at least 16GB RAM, and 2TB storage.
7. Non-Functional Attributes
7.1 Security
•	Requirement: All sensitive data (card numbers, CVV) must be encrypted (AES-256).
•	Requirement: Use SSL/TLS for all communications.
7.2 Reliability
•	Requirement: System must ensure 99.9% uptime.
7.3 Scalability
•	Requirement: Must support expansion to handle international transactions.
7.4 Usability
•	Requirement: Easy-to-use dashboards for merchants and admins.

8. Preliminary Schedule and Budget
8.1 Development Schedule
•	Phase 1 (Design): 2 months
•	Phase 2 (Implementation): 4 months
•	Phase 3 (Testing): 2 months
•	Phase 4 (Deployment and Support): 2 months
8.2 Budget
The estimated budget for the development of the Credit Card Processing System is $500,000. This includes costs for development, security certification, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
