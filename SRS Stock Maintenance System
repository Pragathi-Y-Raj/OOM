Application - Stock Maintenance System

Problem Statement:
Shops and warehouses need to know how much stock they have at any moment. If stock is managed manually, it can lead to missing items, overstocking, or expired goods. This causes losses and customer dissatisfaction. A system is needed that can update stock levels automatically and give real-time alerts.
